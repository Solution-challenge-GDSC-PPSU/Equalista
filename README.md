### Brief introduction regarding idea

Equalista is a community-based platform that aims to address gender inequality in the workplace. Each organization or company will have its own separate group managed by a designated consultant. This consultant will provide guidance to employees on how to address gender inequality issues within the company.

The platform features a community post section where employees can share their experiences with gender inequality and provide guidance to others. Additionally, Equalista will display the organizations that are part of the platform, enabling potential employees to check the company's culture before joining.

Overall, Equalista provides a safe and supportive environment for employees to address and combat gender inequality in the workplace.
